   jsonSettings.py -- wrapper around a text file containing json key/value pairs
   that we can access as either a dict
   settings['key']
   or an object
   settings.key

   You can also set and return a default value for a key that might not exist
   with

   val = settings.GetOrDefault('key', defaultValue)
